#+TITLE: Theme Commands

This directory contains commands specifically designed for use in task bars or status
line segments such as TMUX. Each command can be run to output some relevant data and
then wait and update that data after a fixed interval. The [[file:status-misc][status-misc]] script is
designed as a wrapper around multiple of these standalone scripts that can maintain
run all of them under a single process.
