    This function constructs an asyncrous event loop which continually

    Parameters
    ----------
    pointer
        A pointer to a formatted string that should be printed once this
        function is woken up. For technical reasons this is a list that
        should only contain one element (the string to be printed).
    event
        An async event which will be raised once the value pointed to by
        `pointer` might have changed. Use this to trigger an immediate
        wake up of the print event loop.
    unbuffer
        Whether the standard output stream should be flushed after printing.
    sleep
        A minimum timeout period within which this function should have been
        awoken at least once. This is used to automatically ensure the print
        loop periodically regains control even when none of the statuses have
        been changed.
