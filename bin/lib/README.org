#+TITLE: Library

Here goes shared code for other files/scripts. This is mostly to remove the hassle
of re-defining core logic (eg. logging setup functions) in multiple places.

The only rule here is that each of these should link to a module that can be accessed
through the ~mohkale~ package. That's it. Maybe I'll share it out at some point but for
now this is good enough :)

*NOTE*: Personally I'm not sure how I feel about the =/bin/lib/= path here. It's kind
of backwards. When I get a chance I move it out to the root of my dotfile directory.
