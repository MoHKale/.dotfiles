# shortcuts
This is where you put autoloaded commands, shortcuts and other alias configurations.
Distribution and shell specific shortcuts can be found in the [setup](./setup/)
directory. Autoloaded commands are in the [commands](./commands) directory. For
shells that don't support autoloads (eg. bash), every file in the *commands* directory
will be sourced instead.
