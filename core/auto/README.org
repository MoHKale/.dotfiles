#+TITLE: Autoloads
# LocalWords: Autoloads autoload autoloads zsh

This is where you put auto-loaded commands, meaning shell functions whose loading
can be deferred.
The current directory contains scripts for specific shells and operating-systems.
Standalone auto-loads can be found in the [[file:cmds/][cmds]] directory.

For the purpose of my dotfiles an autoload is a bash-script containing a single
function matching the name of this script. This format was taken directly from
zsh.

For shells that support autoloads like zsh these scripts are deferred until their
invoked. On other shells like bash all the scripts in the scripts directory are
sourced immediately.
