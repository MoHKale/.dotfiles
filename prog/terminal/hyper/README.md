A modern, cross-platform, electron based terminal emulator.

That description alone is enough to turn me off :dragon_face:. But I need a usable terminal
emulator on windows and cmder is proving to be overkill for simple purposes.
[wsltty](../wsl/wsltty.conf) has weird ~~annoying~~ installation issues with chocolatey,
installing st through WSL and an X-Server would work but feels like too much work for
too little gain.

This terminal is far from lightweight or suckless but it's feature-full and can be
made suitably minimal when customised properly. I rarely ever start more than one
terminal-window on Linux so hopefully it'll be good enough on those rare occasions I
see myself drifting back to windows.
